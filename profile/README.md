# Real-time GeoInformation Systems Lab

The Runck [RTGS Lab](https://gems.umn.edu/runck-lab-real-time-geoinformation-systems) is an interdisciplinary lab of scientists and engineers located in the [GEMS Informatics Center](https://gems.umn.edu) at the University of Minnesota. 
Work focuses on real-time spatial data systems (hardware and software) applied to agricultural systems. 
Research and development supports the GEMS Sensing and GEMS Learning Service Organizations at the University of Minnesota. 
Our mandate within the GEMS Informatics Center is both advance the state-of-the-art and support service offerings for other researchers.

## Lab Interests
Real-time geospatial systems, artificial intelligence, and machine learning in the context of agriculture. 

## Lab Research Objectives

Research objectives are to advance the state-of-the-art in geographic information science in order to:
- Identify applied solutions for more efficient and effective integration of real-time spatial data and models to advance agricultural research, management, and policy.
- Identify and test generalizable principles underlying the spatial and temporal dynamics of agent interactions (e.g. human-human, human-environment, environment-plant, etc)
